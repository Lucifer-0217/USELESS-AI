![Useless Version 2](https://example.com/logo.png)  
*Useful Life Enhancing Software System (Useless)*

## Overview

**Useless Version 2** is a powerful desktop-based voice assistant designed to enhance your productivity and provide hands-free control of your system. Built with cutting-edge AI technology, Useless Version 2 can perform a wide range of tasks including controlling system volume, opening/closing applications, managing windows, interacting with the clipboard, performing Google searches, and moreâ€”all via simple voice commands.

This project integrates **OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo** for advanced conversational abilities, allowing the assistant to respond intelligently to both system commands and general inquiries.

## Features

- **Voice-Controlled System Operations**
  - Open/close applications like Notepad, Calculator, Chrome, etc.
  - Manage system volume (mute, unmute, increase, or decrease).
  - Open folders (Documents, Downloads).
  - Perform system control actions like shutdown, restart, and log off.
  
- **Clipboard Interaction**
  - Copy, paste, and view clipboard content.

- **Window Management**
  - Minimize, maximize, and switch between windows.

- **Google Search Integration**
  - Perform Google searches directly from voice commands.

- **Conversational Abilities**
  - Engages in conversations and provides intelligent responses via OpenAI's GPT-3.5.

- **System Control via PyAutoGUI and PyCaw**
  - Desktop interaction with mouse/keyboard control, and audio management using PyCaw.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. Required dependencies (see below)

### Install Required Libraries

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can manually install the modules:

```bash
pip install openai pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition pyautogui pyperclip psutil pycaw comtypes
```

### Configuration

1. Create a `config.py` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```python
   apikey = "your_openai_api_key"
   ```

### Running the Assistant

To start the voice assistant, simply run the Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Upon starting, Useless Version 2 will be ready to listen to your commands!

## Usage

- **Start the assistant**: Once the assistant is running, it will respond to voice commands like:
  - `"Open Notepad"` to open the Notepad application.
  - `"Increase volume"` to adjust system volume.
  - `"Search Google for latest tech news"` to perform a Google search.
  - `"Shut down the system"` to shut down your computer.

- **Conversation**: You can have general conversations with the assistant, ask questions, and interact with it using natural language.

### Example Commands

- `"Open Chrome"`
- `"Close Notepad"`
- `"What time is it?"`
- `"Search for Python tutorials"`
- `"Increase volume"`
- `"Mute the volume"`
- `"Tell me about Amit Kasabe"`
- `"Shut down the system"`

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language for building the assistant.
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo**: For natural language processing and conversational abilities.
- **Pyttsx3**: For text-to-speech capabilities.
- **SpeechRecognition**: To recognize and process voice commands.
- **PyAutoGUI**: For desktop automation (mouse/keyboard interaction).
- **PyCaw**: For system audio management.
- **Psutil**: To manage system processes and tasks.
- **Pyperclip**: To interact with the system clipboard.

## Future Improvements

- Add additional application support for popular programs.
- Enhance voice recognition with custom wake words.
- Expand to multi-language support.
- Integrate with other cloud services for deeper system and online control.
