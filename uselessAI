I may be called Useless, but I run this desktop like a boss. From shutting down your system to opening your favorite apps, I’ve got it all covered. Need some Python code on the fly? I’ll whip it up faster than you can say 'Stack Overflow.' And if you try to outsmart me, remember—I can mute your music and your ego. So go ahead, command away, but just know... I’m always listening.
